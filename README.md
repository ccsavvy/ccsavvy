## Hi there 👋

**I’m a software developer & chess-enthusiast from Cebu, Philippines.**

### 🔭 I’m currently working on  
- Building Android mobile applications using Kotlin/Java and modern Android tools.  
- A couple of personal side projects — utility apps and experiments with clean UI/UX and performance optimizations.  

### 🌱 I’m currently learning  
- Advanced Android development with Jetpack Compose, modern architectures, and best practices.  
- Algorithms, data structures, and chess-related logic (because I love solving problems — on board *and* in code).  

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
- Android / mobile apps — open-source or community-driven projects.  
- Chess-related utilities or games (e.g. analysis tools, bots, puzzles).  
- Anything that combines logic, clean code, and fun 😄  

### 💬 Ask me about  
- Android development (Kotlin, Java, Jetpack libraries)  
- Chess & strategy (openings, puzzles, tactics)  
- Clean code, UI design, and good software practices  

### 📫 How to reach me  
- Email: **christianlumapac@gmail.com**  
- GitHub: **[@ccsavvy](https://github.com/ccsavvy)**  
- LinkedIn / Twitter / Portfolio: *(https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-lumapac-1b3b265a/)*

### ⚡ Fun fact  
- I enjoy switching between coding and thinking a few moves ahead — whether it’s planning app architecture or a chess endgame. ♟️  
- When I’m not coding or playing chess, I like exploring new libraries, reading about design patterns, or inventing tiny utilities for everyday use.
